**PMWeather is making my game run like crap**: 

* to fix: esc -> mods -> protomanly Weather mod -> client config and change the graphics from medium to potato.

**Claiming**:

* Simply do /kit grief, use the golden shovel to claim ur area. and /unclaim (/abandonclaim) to unclaim.

**Canceling EAS Alerts**: 

* Simply do `/alerts` to grab the alert id then `/removealert <id>`

**Radar doesnt work**:

*  If its all static, its because you dont have a radome near (its a 3x3 range for the radomes) Head over to the [Wiki entry for Radomes](https://wiki.solarspire.net/Minecraft/Servers/ResistanceCraft/Radome/) to find out how.
