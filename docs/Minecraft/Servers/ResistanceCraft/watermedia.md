### Rules

* Any content that breaks [Section I: Rule 5 (including suggestive)](https://discord.com/channels/461596900949229598/471151197424713769/1382970159043448904) will result in having your upload privileges __***PERMANENTLY***__ removed, and a minimum 72 hour in-game ban. If you help another player evade this you will also receive the same punishment.

***If you think your content may violate this rule ask a staff member __BEFORE__ uploading it.***

* Any uploaded videos may __**not**__ contain sound.
* Using the site to host content not meant for in-game use will also result in having your upload privileges __***PERMANENTLY***__ removed.
* Tampering with frames that do not belong to you unless given explicit permission will result in a minimum 24 hour in-game ban.
* Do not make overly large frames for no reason.
* We reserve the right to issue punishments for rules that are not listed here.
* Placeholder for something else I'll probably have to add.

### Miscellanous

## I noticed a lot of duplicate uploads for NWS logos. I'll post mine so you don't need to upload your own.
